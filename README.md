# Paddle-Game
A silly little combo-based (sorta) game that can maybe sooth your ADHD, sort of like a zen version of pong with 8-bit sounds, and a score counter
Setup:
put the files anywhere, aslong as they are together, and put all ".mp3" files into a folder named sound that is inside of the parent of the ".py" along with the font file :)
